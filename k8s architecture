Kubernetes cluster has master node and slave nodes (worker node). master and worker nodes are together called as k8s cluster

----------------------------xx----------------------------------------------
                worker node
each worker node has multiple pods in it 
3 proceeses must be installed on every worker node
There three processes are -- kubelet,container run time and kube proxy
container run time--> it is nothing but a container. e.g: docker
kubelet --->it is a communication service. it does the actual work.
it intereacts with the container and node.
it starts the pod with the container inside
kube proxy --> it forwards the requests properly. Lets assume there are two replicasets.
how the kubenerets know traffic should be routed to which replica or which pod?
thats where kube proxy arrives and forwars requests properly
------------------------------------x------------------------------------------
                   Master node
how do you interact witha cluster? how do you schedule pods?how do you monitor them? thats where the master node arrives and does these duties
master process has 4 processes running in it
api server --> it is the one client communicates with query or update or whatver communication do
It is the gateway to the cluster and does the authentication
if end user send the request it validates and processes the requests
scheduler --> how to schedule pod or deploy a pod or route to the correct pod if pod 1 is full
generally,it schedules the pod.   end user --> api server -->scheduler-->where to put the pod
controller manager --> it detects the state changes. health,resource abailable,pod down etc.  controller manager-->scheduler-->kubelet
etcd --> known as cluster brain.cluster changbes are stored in key value pair. It knows ebery informstion. e.g. health,resource availabe,cluster state change etc. note:application data are not stored in etc. only cluster data are stored

in gerenal we will be having two master nodes and more than 3 worker nodes.
